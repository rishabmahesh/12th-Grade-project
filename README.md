# 12th-Grade-project

@Authors: Rishab Maheshwari and Saransh Oberoi

Inspired by e-travel websites like makemytrip, me and my partner created a C++ project similar to a travel website.
The project has 5 trip offers (namely: God's own country (kerela), The Westcoast Ride (Mumbai, Goa, Mangalore, Kochi, Allepey), The Golden Triangle (Agra, Delhi, Jaipur), The Hillside Fun (Shimla, Jammu and Kashmir, Srinagar, Dehradun), and Enjoy The Sunset.
Even though the locations are pre-planned, the customer has the freedom to choose the date, food, and tour guide. 

Things used in this project: Files, Classes, Functions, Pointers, and Graphics.
